1 (Investigaion): Algorithm that draws squares over a given backdrop, backdrop will also be algorithmically generated. Could also do fractals as another possibility and simply implement a mathematical equation in code after understanding how the math for the fractal itself works. Yet another possibility would be to have a moving turtle which bounces, a la bouncing dvd screensaver. 

2 (Planning): We decided to make an algorithm that generates a cube and an algorithm which generates a rainbow behind it.  We'll divide these up into functions which go into their own respective python files for greater encapsulation and then from there import them into a file named main.py which will actually execute the program in its entirety. The design of this will help increase readability overall and make things far more pleasing to the eye for outside viewers.

3 (Designing): We'll take a bottom up approach in which we design individual functions and then throw them together within the final program instead of a top down approach where we design everything and attempt to split hairs from there. Our first algorithm will be one which generates a cube which is scaleable and can be different sizes. Our second algorithm will draw a rainbow gradient behind the cube as a backdrop.
