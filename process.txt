1. INVESTIGATION: Algorithm that draws squares over a given backdrop, backdrop will also be algorithmically generated. Could also do fractals as another possibility and simply implement a mathematical equation in code after understanding it.

2. PLANNING: We decided to go with the former in the previous point, being making a backdrop and then drawing squares over it. We'll divide the work up between ourselves as equal as possible to ensure a workload in which we both get done near the same time.

3. DESIGNING: We'll take a bottom up approach in which we design individual functions and then throw them together within the final program instead of a top down approach where we design everything and attempt to split hairs from there. *** TODO: needs to state pseudocode for algos
